This project is showing algorithms of "Operations and Maintenance for Multipurpose Offshore Platforms using Statistical Weather Window Analysis" presented in Global OCEANS 2020: Singapore â€“ U.S. Gulf Coast.

This study proposed a framework to develop an Operation & Maintanence (O&M) strategy for multipurpose offshore platforms. The approach describes an optimized decision making policy given stochastic weather data, as well as O&M activity and cost constraints. Exhaustive evaluation of all scenarios is possible using a Markov Decision Policy framework that can be employed in planned blue economy projects.
